# Housing_prices_prediction

In this project I used a housing dataset for predicting house prices. The main goal is to find the variables that are significant in predicting the prices of a house and how much these variables influence the house prices. To achieve this I used Lasso and ridge regression techniques after performing EDA, data cleaning and data preparation.
